## HTML/CSS Project

### Overview

This is the first real project for the Odin Project, emulating the Google Homepage and a Google search results page using HTML and CSS.
In some ways, this is review for me, but since it has been a long time since I used some of these skills it is good for me to do.
Also, using the Chrome Developer Tools is brand new to me, so that'll be fun.

### Some Skills That I May be Using

1. Move a div around on the page
2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
3. Identify the background color of an existing webpage
4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
5. Center an element horizontally
6. Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere)
